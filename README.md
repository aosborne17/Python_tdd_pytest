#TDD and Pytest

TDD Stands for Text Driven Development
a software development process that relies on the repetition 
of a very short development cycle. The equirements are turned into 
very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass.

test file must include the key word TEST\
'calc_test', python recognises that this is the test file.
